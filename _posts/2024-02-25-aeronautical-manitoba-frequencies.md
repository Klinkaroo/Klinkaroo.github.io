> Unauthorized use of aeronautical frequencies, critical for flight safety, is illegal and dangerous. These frequencies require a [Restricted Operator Certificate with Aeronautical Qualification from ISED](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/licences-and-certificates/professional-radio-operator-certificates) for legal operation. Aviation band radios are not mandatory. Receive only scanners can safely receive these frequencies without interference, ensuring compliance and safety.
